# Starbucks App User Behavior Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes user behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app, aiming to understand the effectiveness of different promotional offers. The dataset includes information about customer demographics, offer characteristics, and user interactions with offers. The analysis leverages various data science techniques to uncover patterns and predict offer effectiveness.

## How to Use

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
   - Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Open Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook from the terminal using `jupyter notebook`.
   - Open the `StarbucksWorkspace.ipynb` notebook.

3. **Run All Cells:**
   - Execute all cells in the notebook to perform data loading, preprocessing, analysis, and model development.

4. **Interact with Analysis:**
   - Explore the code cells to understand the data exploration, cleaning, preprocessing, and model development steps.
   - Review visualizations and insights generated throughout the analysis.
